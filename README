--- mail to linux-usb ----


I've been using OpenWrt's "usb activity" led trigger to display
usb-serial traffic over a cp210x dongle quite successfully, but after
replacing the cp210x with a FT230x, I find that I get constant USB
traffic (every millisecond) as soon as the port is opened.

I've put a usbmon capture available here:
https://github.com/karlp/ftx-linux-us...
 (Captured with tcpdump -i usbmon1 -w ...., then opening the port with picocom, waiting, then exiting)

This is from opening /dev/ttyUSB0 with picocom.  I've added ftdio_sio
module debugging, which produces the following output

[ 5829.430000] ftdi_sio ttyUSB0: Setting CS8
[ 5829.430000] ftdi_sio ttyUSB0: get_ftdi_divisor - tty_get_baud_rate reports speed 19200

[ 5857.520000] ftdi_sio ttyUSB0: ftdi_get_modem_status - 0x0160

It's important to note that /dev/ttyUSB0 still _works_ I just get
substantially more usb traffic than I expect.  I do _not_ see this level
of traffic with any FT232RL devices or cp210x devices, though,
unfortunately, I can't test those with the same hardware.  The FT230x is
permanently connected to a SMSC USB2640 hub on a custom board.  I also
don't have a FT230x I can try on my desktop linux either at this stage.
:(

This is seen with kernel 3.18.12, but was originally seen with 3.10.49. 
I can't see anything in the ftdio_sio driver other than new VID/PIDs
since 3.18, so I haven't tried anything newer.  

The usbmon traces seem to be a continual reporting of the "0x0160" shown
in the ftdi_get_modem_status lines.  Is this actually _meant_ to be
happening?  Can I turn it off?  Any other suggestions?

Sincerely,
Karl Palsson
